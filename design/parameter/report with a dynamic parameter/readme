This example illustrates linking a report parameter to a data set parameter.

BIRT provides the capability to build queries and define filter conditions prior to running the query. The example here uses a separate dataset (OrderNumber) to present the user with a list of dynamic parameter values to choose from in a combo box. The selected value is used as a filter condition inside a SQL query that will fetch only subset of data from the database.

This report was designed in BIRT 2.2.2.
