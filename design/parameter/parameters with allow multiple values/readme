When you need to select multiple input values for a parameter is useful to allow the user to select an option which includes all values, avoiding him the entire selection from a long list.
In this report input parameter are:
- customer
- country

Both parameters allow to select multiple values.
By selecting 0 (zero) you implicitly select all values of a parameter, but in that case filter dataset must be disabled.
This task is done in report's beforeFactory phase.
