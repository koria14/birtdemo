Example BIRT design with Control Chart
This is an example of a BIRT report that contains a Control Chart. The control chart in this example is a line chart that uses multiple Y-axis series for the measure, upper and lower control lines, and the center line(mean). This example was built with BIRT version 2.2.

*Updated - now includes 2.1.3 and 2.2 versions of the report design
