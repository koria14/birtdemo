Example report design using property binding to control data for inner chart.
BIRT report design that shows how to create an inner chart within a table that will use different values for each table.  This example shows two different ways to include a chart directly in a detail row that uses a different set that requires a parameter.  Another approach uses an inner table (with hidden rows) and the chart uses the container values.

This example was created with BIRT 2.2.0
