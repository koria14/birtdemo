Example that demonstrates adding a separator every 3 rows within a group.

This example illustrates adding a separator every 3 rows within a group.  Scripting is done on the detail row of the table to increment a counter.  When the 4th line of a group is reached, the counter resets and counts that line as the first of the new section. This count is also reset on a page break.  A visibility rule is set on the "breaker" line to only display when the counter reaches 3 detail rows.
