Simple BIRT report that uses POJOs for dataThis is a simple BIRT report design example that uses POJOs as a data source.  In this example, the data set has script in the fetch and open method to get data from a Java class.

This example works with BIRT 2.2.1 and higher - Updated on 6/16/08 with another example that fills the parameter selection from the Java object and applies a filter to the table of data based on the parameter.
